# JobHunt
## A automatically job searching and applying system using AI
During the process of searching for a job, it may be very tedious to scrolling through a list of jobs from multiple recruitment channels (vietnamwork, ybox, topdev, topcv, itviec, etc.) with the hope of finding out few jobs that match job hunters' desire. Therefore, this project is created with the expectation of providing jobs that not only provide the jobs that the job hunters want, but also jobs that suit with their capability. The system contains these features:  

* Customize the list of potential jobs base on job requirement provided by job hunters.
* Ability to automatically apply for jobs from the list of recommended jobs.
* Generate CV that matches the job requirement using AI.
* Analye job whether it matches both job requirement from employers as well as job hunter ability using AI.
* Provide friendly UI on web for accessibility.
* Maintaining user's projects (will be used for analying job).
* Maintaining user's profile (will be used for job analysis).
